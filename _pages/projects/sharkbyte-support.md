**Smart support in every byte.** Transform any website into an AI-powered customer support agent in seconds.

## What is SharkByte?

SharkByte instantly creates an AI chatbot that can answer questions about any website. Just paste a URL, and we handle the rest - no FAQ writing, no training, no complex setup.

## How It Works

1. Enter a website URL
2. We crawl and analyze the content
3. Your AI support agent is ready to chat

The system orchestrates three key processes: website scraping, knowledge base ingestion, and AI agent conversations - all seamlessly connected to give Sammy the knowledge he needs.

## Features

- **Instant Setup** - No configuration required
- **Website-Aware** - Answers based on actual site content
- **Streaming Responses** - Real-time chat experience
- **Theme Options** - Light, Dark, and Ocean modes
- **Mobile Friendly** - Works on all devices
- **Embeddable Widget** - Add to any website with one script tag

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16.0 (App Router + Turbopack)
- **UI Library**: React 19.2
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui
- **AI**: DigitalOcean Gradient AI
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Key Challenges

The biggest challenge was orchestrating asynchronous processes between scraping, knowledge base initialization, and agent setup. System prompt engineering also required careful attention to maintain Sammy's helpful demeanor and brand consistency across all interactions.

## Future Roadmap

- Embeddable chat widgets for any website
- Custom branding options
- Conversation analytics dashboard
- Multi-language support
