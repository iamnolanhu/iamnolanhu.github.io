## Origin Story

I've been taking things apart since I could hold a screwdriver. That curiosity led me through a decade in financial services—building data pipelines at JPMorgan, automating workflows at HSBC, and managing cyber risk at BNY Mellon. Along the way, I earned a BlackHat USA scholarship, competed in CTFs, and realized that the most interesting problems live at the intersection of security, data, and automation.

Now I'm the founder of Sigma Synapses, where I build AI-powered business solutions. Same curiosity, bigger playground. I take enterprise-grade engineering experience and combine it with modern LLMs, RAG architecture, and workflow automation to help businesses actually ship things.

Brooklyn-based. Bilingual in English and Cantonese/Mandarin.

## Philosophy

I believe in building. Not planning to build, not talking about building—actually shipping things. Hackathons taught me that constraints create clarity. Give me 24 hours and a problem, and I'll give you a working solution.

I also believe that the best engineers understand business. Data without context is noise. Automation without strategy is overhead. The goal isn't to write clever code—it's to solve real problems.

## Beyond the Code

Tech is what I do. It's not all I am.

**Apex for Youth** (2016-2023) — I mentored an immigrant student from middle school through high school graduation. Seven years of showing up, helping with homework, navigating college apps, and being someone they could count on.

**CPC Leadership Council** (2020-2024) — Served on the advisory board supporting youth development programs in the Chinese-American community. Facilitated emotional intelligence workshops and helped with fundraising initiatives.

**JPMorgan Force for Good** (2017-2018) — Volunteered with the Coalition for the Homeless, helping fix their shelter locator and modernize nonprofit tech infrastructure.

## Hacker Cred

The resume says "computer systems technology." The reality is I've been in the security community for over a decade:

- **BlackHat USA** — Full attendance scholarship recipient
- **ShmooCon** — Two-time scholarship recipient (2014, 2015)
- **CSAW 2014** — DHS Quiz, 3rd Place
- **CTF Competitions** — Active in CSAW CTF, picoCTF, OverTheWire
- **NBC Comcast Universal Hackathon** — Beamly Challenge Winner (2014)
- **NSF S-STEM Scholarship** — Two-time National Science Foundation STEM scholarship recipient

## Fun Facts

- I've won hackathons a decade apart (2014 and 2025)
- I manage 12+ production applications on DigitalOcean
- I still use vim
- My first "real" job was being the sole IT person for a 20-person company at Globe Language Services
- I think the best debugging tool is a good night's sleep (though I rarely take my own advice)
