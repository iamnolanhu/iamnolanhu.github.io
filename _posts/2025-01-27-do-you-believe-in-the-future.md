Do you believe in the future?

It's a strange question. Scroll through any feed and you'll find a hundred reasons not to. AI will take your job. The world is ending. We're building things we can't control. The takes are loud, and honestly, some of them aren't wrong.

But here's the thing: belief in the future isn't a prediction. It's a posture.

I've spent the last few years building with AI—shipping projects at hackathons, launching tools that didn't exist six months ago, watching the gap between "idea" and "working product" shrink to almost nothing. I've seen enough hype cycles to know better than blind optimism. But I've also seen what happens when builders stop waiting for permission.

The tools are getting better. The barriers are getting lower. And the people who show up—who actually make things—are the ones shaping what comes next.

So the real question isn't whether the future will be good. It's whether you'll help make it good.

I choose to believe. Not because I'm certain, but because belief is the thing that makes you build. And building is the only way forward.
